**Data:** Single cell data was downloaded from NCBI GEO series GSE145926. Some of the Seurat R code used in this repository were adopted and modified from the publication titled "Single-cell landscape of bronchoalveolar immune cells in COVID-19 patients". 10X Genomics filtered_feature_bc_matrix files were acquired from the above mentioned GEO serise.
